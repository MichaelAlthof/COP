Name of Quantlet: COPhac3dscatter1
 
Published in:     Copulae

Description:     'COPhac3dscatter1 gives samples generated from an HAC copula, where the red points
                  stands for the 1100 scatter points drawn from the hierarchical Archimedean copula.
                  In this case we use a Gumbel generator function and the marginals contain a Student-t
                  for variabel x2, the normal for variable x1 and also the normal for x3. The parameter
                  for x1 and x2 in the first hierarchy is 10 and in the second hierarchy the parameter 
                  is 2. The blue points on the vertical plane stand for the projection of the red points
                  onto the plane x1 and x3. The blue points on the bottom plane stand for the projection
                  of the red points onto the plane x1 and x2.'
