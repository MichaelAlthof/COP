Published in: Copulae

Description: 'COPlcpinVaR computes from the results of fitting a Aparch(1, 1) model to daily returns, see COPlcpinaparch, and choosing the HAC model, see COPlcpinres, the profit and loss function (dots) with the 99%-VaR bound (solid line) and the time points of the exceedances (pluses).'

Input: 
     
Output:  'The Quantlet returns plots which show the profit and loss function (dots) for index data with the 99%-VaR bound (solid line) and the time points of the exceedances (pluses) for the HAC model with Gumbel and Clayton generators.'


Example: The example is performed for the indizes DAX, DJ and NIKKEI in the time span [1.1.1985; 23.12.2010] using the Gumbel copula.
