Published in: Copulae

Description: 'COPdensitydaxreturn gives the DAX histogram compared to the 3 densities including
              the standard normal density in red, the Student-t density in green with degrees 
              of freedom equal to 5 and the estimated Epanechnikov kernel density in blue with 
              the bandwidth computed following that 0.9 times the minimum of the standard deviation
              and the interquartile range divided by 1.34 times the sample size to the negative
              one-fifth power, i.e. Silverman's rule-of-thumb.'
