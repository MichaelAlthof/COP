Published in:           Copulae

Description:		'Six bivariate copula plots and their corresponding contour plots are created including the Gaussian copula, the Gumbel copula and the Clayton copula. In the figure, the upper blue picture is a normal copula with 2 Gaussian margins and an exchangeable parameter equal to 0.71. The lower blue plot is a normal copula with 2 Student-t margins with degree of freedom equal to 3. The upper red plot is a Gumbel copula with 2 standard normal margins and an exchangeable parameter is 2. The lower red plot is also a Gumbel copula with 2 t margins under degree of freedom of 3. The upper green plot is a Clayton copula with 2 standard normal margins with an exchangeable parameter of 2. The lower green plot uses the same copula with the upper green but 2 t margins with degree of freedom equal to 3.'
