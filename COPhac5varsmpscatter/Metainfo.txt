Name of Quantlet: COPhac5varsmpscatter
 
Published in: Copulae

Description: 'COPhac5varsmpscatter gives a plot of pairwise scatter plot of an HAC sample with 5 dimensions and a Gumbel generator. The parameter for X3, X4, X4 equals 2.005 and for ((X3, X4, X5), X2, X1) it is 1.005. According to these structure we construct an HAC with a Gumbel generator. Then 1500 random numbers are drawn from this HAC. Hence, for every variable we obtain 1500 numbers. Then for each pair of two variables we can obtain a scatter plot.'
