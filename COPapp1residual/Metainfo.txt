Description: 'COPapp1residual shows pairwise scatter plots of based on AR(1)-GARCH(1,1)
fitted residuals. The 3 upper triangular plots show the pairwise residuals scatter points.
The 3 lower triangular plots show the scatter points computed from empirical cdf of the
residuals. Companies Apple (AAPL), the Hewlett Packard (HP) and Microsoft (MSFT) are contained.'
