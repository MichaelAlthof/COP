Name of Quantlet: COPhac3dscatter2
 
Published in: Copulae

Description: 'COPhac3dscatter2 gives samples generated from an hierarchical Archimedean copula (HAC), where the red points stand for the 1100 scatter points drawn from the HAC. The generator of this HAC is Gumbel and the marginals here contain the Student-t CDF for variable x1, the normal CDF for x2 and the normal CDF for x3. The parameter for x1 and x3 in the first hierarchy is 10 and in the second hierarchy the parameter is 2. The blue points on the vertical plane stand for the projection of the red points onto the plane x1 and x3. The blue points on the bottom plane stand for the projection of the red points onto the plane x1 and x2.'
