Description:     'COPdaxnormhist gives histogram of DAX returns compared to the normal CDF.
                  Here the normal simulations are based on the parameters that mean = 0.0002
                  and standard deviation = 0.0141. In the plot, the blue straps plus the purple
                  straps stand for the DAX returns'' histogram, and the pink straps plus the 
                  purple straps stand for the histogram of the normal simulations with the 
                  aforementioned parameters. And the purple straps stand for the overlapped parts
                  of the both histograms. Here the number of the points of the time series used in
                  the computation is 5771, which is the same number as the number of the normal 
                  simulations'
